# Assignment2


For this assignment, the idea was to create a game that was related to cars. I came up with the idea to create a game to dodge objects on a road with the car. I liked the idea of the head down display of the original Grand Thief Auto. 

Menu

The game consists of a menu to start and instructions. You start the game by pressing “S” and read the instructions is by pressing “I”. The instructions are read in from a file. 

Controls

The controls are basic. The controls are using the left and right keys to move the car. The object of the game is to dodge the objects for as long as you can.
