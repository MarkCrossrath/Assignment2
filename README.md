For this assignment, the idea was to create a game that was related to cars. I came up with the idea to create a game to dodge objects on a road with the car. I liked the idea of the head down display of the original Grand Thief Auto. 
Features 

There are 5 stage of this game 

Startup screen: This is the first screen that is seen.
Menu screen: This where you can select your options.
Instructions: The instructions are read from a file when you Press I
Crash: The game is over when you crash 

Menu

The game consists of a menu to start and instructions. You start the game by pressing “S” and read the instructions is by pressing “I”. The instructions are read in from a file. 

Controls

The controls are basic. The controls are using the mouse to move the car. The object of the game is to dodge the objects for as long as you can. 

Steps used

For this program I tried my hardest to draw everything. The track was drawing using basic shape functions. The first car was then drawn. This was drawn PVectors and PShape. The other car I was an image I found on google images as I didn’t a lot of time left to draw it and have its simulation working. 

Evaluation 

I enjoyed doing this project but time was a problem. The hardest part to get working was drawing the car and the simulation.
